# **ESP-8266-particle-sensor**
IoT air quality tracking with the Shinyei PPD42-ns sensor or the Samyoung DSM501A.

# Goal

Create an IoT particulate matter sensor for measuring and tracking air quality.

# Background

After living in the Bay Area and Isla Vista, and working in a nasty solar cell factory, 
my respiratory system was effected and I became interested in measuring air quality.  
There are a lot of good air quality sensors out there -- that cost $5k.  Even the cheapest ones 
cost $300 if you want to connect them to a computer to save the data, and they aren't even 
Wifi-enabled.

I set out to make an IoT dust concentration sensor, that can be used for air purifiers, 
in industry, and households, and in our dirty cities, to check the quality of the air by 
measuring particulate matter.
This is that project.

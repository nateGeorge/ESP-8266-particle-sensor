Used a 22k resistor and 10uF capacitor to convert PWM to analog, trying to set the P2 threshold on the DSM501A.  
No success with it though, even with the duty cycle at 1/255, it was still reading well below the P1 value.
On the shinyei sensor, it seemed to work better.

The voltage difference across the P2 setpoint and GND is 1.8V by default on the DSM501A.  Putting a 27K (or 22k+4.7k)
resistor from p2-ground changes the voltage difference to 0.8V, and the measurements seem in line with the P1 measurements 
as they should be.  Putting a 10k resistor lowers the voltage to 0.45V, and the measurements are much higher than the P1
value, along the lines I'd expect (about 4x the 1 micron numbers).
